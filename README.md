<h2>What Is Thymosin Alpha‑1?</h2>
<p><strong>Thymosin Alpha‑1</strong> (Tα1) is a synthetic <em>peptide</em> that mimics a naturally occurring thymic hormone. It acts as an <strong>immune system modulator</strong>, supporting T‑cell maturation, boosting cytokine release, and enhancing antiviral defenses. As a popular choice in <em>peptide therapy</em>, Tα1 shows promise in biohacking circles for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Immune support</strong> and resilience</li>
  <li><strong>Faster recovery</strong> from workouts or illness</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced inflammation</strong> via balanced cytokines</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Tested &amp; Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I evaluated Swisschems Thymosin Alpha‑1 across four key areas: <strong>purity</strong>, <strong>price</strong>, <strong>shipping</strong>, and <strong>results</strong>. Here’s my exact protocol:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Baseline week:</strong> Measured resting heart rate, sleep quality, and response to a mild cold.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 0.5mg subcutaneous injection every other day for 4 weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Logged daily energy, recovery time after workouts, and any immune challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer feedback:</strong> Shared kits with three friends; collected their recovery and mood reports.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 28 days, I scored Swisschems Tα1 9.2/10 overall—purity tested at >98% by third‑party HPLC, shipping arrived in 5 days, and the price per mg was competitive compared to other peptide vendors.</p>

<h2>My Personal Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Recovery time ↓ 30%</strong>: Post‑workout soreness faded faster. I could hit the gym again in 24–36 hours instead of 48–72.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy boost</strong>: Noticeable uptick in morning energy and focus, especially on injection days.</li>
  <li><strong>Better sleep</strong>: Fell asleep 15 minutes faster and woke up feeling refreshed.</li>
  <li><strong>Immune resilience</strong>: I had a mild sniffle in week 3—symptoms were mild and cleared in 2 days vs. my usual 5–7 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Side effects:</strong> Minimal. Slight redness at injection site for 10–15 minutes; no headaches or mood swings.</li>
</ul>
